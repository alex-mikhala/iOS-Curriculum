# 2.1 The Setup

This workshop will be a quick introduction on how to use Xcode to create iOS apps.

1. **how to create + use an Xcode project**
2. **how to add UI elements + connect them to logic**
3. **how to run your project on your own iPhone**

_First let's start with how to create an Xcode project._

`// todo: add links to headers (+ playground pages?)`

## Xcode Projects

An [Xcode Project](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/XcodeConcepts/Concept-Projects.html) is a repository for all the files, resources, and information required to build a software application.

_You can think of it as the box that holds all the pieces and assembly instructions we need to build our app._

Let's create our first **Project** by opening Xcode and selecting the open _Create a new Xcode project_ option in the **Welcome to Xcode** window (if it doesn't show up, press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> to bring it up).

In the window that appears, select the **iOS Single View App** and press next.
