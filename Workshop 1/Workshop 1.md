# 1. Getting Started with Swift

This workshop is about learning how to code in Swift, using Xcode Playgrounds.

| Topics       | Details            |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Datatypes   | declarations, `Int`, `Double`, `String`, `Array`, `Dictionary`, `Boolean` |
| Control flow | `if`, `for`, Scoping |
| Functions    | calling + writing functions, nested functions |
| Optionals    | what are they?     |
| Playgrounds  | how to play around with swift code |

# 1.1 A Swift Start

This will be a quick introduction into how to write Swift code.
- how to create and modify variables
  - _and how to print them_
- how to write control flow
- what are Optionals?
  - _and why should I use them?_

## Opening Playgrounds

First let's open a **Playground** in Xcode. Playgrounds is a development environment for Swift created by Apple. It allows you to write code and see it in action immediately.

You can open a **Playground** by opening Xcode and selecting the open _Get started with a playground_ option in the **Welcome to Xcode** window (if it doesn't show up, press <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> to bring it up).

In the window that appears, select a **blank iOS template**, give your playground a name, and then press next.

If you want more information on how to do this, check out this online tutorial: [Get Started With Xcode Playgrounds](https://learnappmaking.com/xcode-playground-get-started-with-swift/).

You should see a window like this.

`// todo: add initial playgrounds image`

Let's write your first line of Swift code.

``` swift
print("hello world")
```

Press <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> to run this line, or press the **Run** button in the linenumbers or at the bottom left of the code editor.

`// todo: add run playground buttons image`

You should see the result on the right side of the code editor. Congrats you have now written your first line of Swift code!

## Datatypes

### Declarations

#### `let`

#### `var`

### `Int`

### `Boolean`

### `Double`

### `String`

### `Array`

### `Dictionary`

## Control flow

### `if`

### `for`

## Functions

## Optionals

# 1.2 Playing around with Swift

Now that we have a basic understanding of how to write some Swift code, let's build a basic app in playgrounds.

## Playgrounds

## Additional Topics

These are some useful topics that I would suggest reading into, and learning how to use them.

- Enums / Structs / Classes
