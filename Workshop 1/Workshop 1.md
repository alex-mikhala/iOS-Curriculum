# 1. Getting Started with Swift

This workshop is about learning how to code in Swift, using Xcode Playgrounds.

| Topics       | Details            |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Datatypes   | declarations, `Int`, `Double`, `String`, `Array`, `Dictionary`, `Boolean` |
| Control flow | `if`, `for`, Scoping |
| Functions    | calling + writing functions, nested functions |
| Optionals    | what are they?     |
| Playgrounds  | how to play around with swift code |

# 1.1 A Swift Start

This will be a quick introduction into how to write Swift code.
- how to create and modify variables
  - and how to print them
- how to write control flow
- what are Optionals?
  - and why should I use them?

## Opening Playgrounds

First let's open a Playground in Xcode...

## Datatypes

### Declarations

#### `let`

#### `var`

### `Int`

### `Boolean`

### `Double`

### `String`

### `Array`

### `Dictionary`

## Control flow

### `if`

### `for`

## Functions

## Optionals

# 1.2 Playing around with Swift

Now that we have a basic understanding of how to write some Swift code, let's build a basic app in playgrounds.

## Playgrounds

## Additional Topics

These are some useful topics that I would suggest reading into, and learning how to use them.

- Enums / Structs / Classes
