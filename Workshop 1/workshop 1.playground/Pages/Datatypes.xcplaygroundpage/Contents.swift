 # Datatypes

 Now that we have our playground setup, let's talk about Swift.

 Swift like any other programming languages uses datatypes and variables. A **datatype** is a particular type of data item, defined by:

 - the values it can take
 - the operations that can be performed by it

 A **variable** is an instance of a datatype.

 Datatypes and variables are the tools used by programmers to solve larger problems, and in order to know which tools is best for a given problem, you need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each datatype.

 **In this workshop we will only cover a few of the basic datatypes in Swift such as:**

 - `Int` (integer)
 - `Double` (decimal number)
 - `Bool` (true / false)
 - `String` (text)
 - `Array` (ordered list)
 - `Dictionary` (list with key + value pairs)
