 # Datatypes

 _Now that we have our playground setup, let's talk about Swift._

 Swift, like any other programming language uses datatypes and variables. Swift is a _type-safe_ language, which means that it helps you be clear about which types of values your code works with. This ensures that you don't pass the wrong types of values by mistake, helping you catch errors quicker in the development process.
 
 A **datatype** is a particular type of data item, defined by:

 - the values it can take
 - the operations that can be performed by it

 A **variable** is an instance of a datatype, often given a descriptive name.

 Datatypes and variables are the tools used by programmers to solve larger problems, and in order to know which tools is best for a given problem, you need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each datatype.
