 # Control Flow
 
 Now that we've learned about different datatypes and how to create and use them, we now need to learn about another fundamental building block of programming: **Control Flow**.
 
 Control flow allows us to create different actions and combinations of actions based on certain conditions.
 
 You might have already seen some control flow in the examples we've used, but now we're going to go over them in-depth.
 
 - _"Swift provides a variety of control flow statements. These include while loops to perform a task multiple times; if, guard, and switch statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions; and statements such as break and continue to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code"_ â€” [Swift Book](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ControlFlow.html)
