# iOS Curriculum

This is a series of **5 workshops** designed to walk you through every step in the iOS app development process: how to install Xcode, how to design and program your app, and how to put your app on your phone.

**Each workshop will build on the previous ones;** if you missed a workshop or you just want to join in halfway through the series, all the material covered in each workshop can be found in its respective workshop folder.

// todo insert folder links here:

This series of workshops is designed for beginners. Even if you have never created a program before, you should be able to follow along. If you get lost while actually attending the workshops, you can view all the material online and work on it at your own pace at the [GitHub repo](github.com/riconaranjo/iOS-Curriculum/tree/master).

## The Finish Line

If you made it through all of these workshops, then congratulations! You are now a super totally officially certified ðŸ”¥ iOS Master. I hope you learned a lot and enjoyed participating in my workshops.

After this I would suggest you keep going, try and make something you think would be cool to make; perhaps make something that you can't find on the app store, or perhaps see if you can replicate an already famous app.
